# Text Improvement Engine README
## Overview
The Text Improvement Engine is a tool designed to analyze a given text and suggest improvements based on the similarity to a list of standardized phrases. The goal of this project is to help users enhance the quality and consistency of their written content by aligning it with predefined standard phrases.

## Features
- User-friendly text analysis and improvement suggestions.
- Utilizes NLTK and scikit-learn for natural language processing and similarity scoring.
- Supports custom lists of standardized phrases.
- Provides similarity scores to gauge the relevance of suggestions.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.7+
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
pandas
CSV file for standard phrases storage
Setup
Python Environment:

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed on your system.

Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas
Download NLTK Data:

Run the following Python script to download the NLTK data:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
Standard Phrases:

Create a CSV file named Standardised terms.csv that contains the standardized phrases you want to use. Each phrase should be in a separate row in the first column.

Example CSV format:

python
Copy code
Standardized Phrase
Optimal performance
Utilize resources
Enhance productivity
...
Input Text:

Prepare the text you want to analyze and save it in a file named sample_text.txt.

Usage
Run the provided Python script (text_improvement.py) to analyze the input text and receive improvement suggestions based on the standardized phrases. Make sure to adjust the similarity threshold as needed.

bash
Copy code
python text_improvement.py
Design Decisions
Text Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed by tokenizing it into sentences and words, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. This helps improve the accuracy of similarity calculations.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity with TF-IDF vectors is used to measure the similarity between input sentences and standardized phrases. It provides a numeric score for similarity.

Threshold: A similarity threshold of 0.4 is set to control the suggestions' relevance. You can adjust this threshold based on your specific needs.

Custom Standard Phrases: The tool allows you to define custom lists of standardized phrases by modifying the Standardised terms.csv file.

Example Output
The tool will provide suggestions for improving the input text by replacing phrases with their more "standard" versions, along with similarity scores.
